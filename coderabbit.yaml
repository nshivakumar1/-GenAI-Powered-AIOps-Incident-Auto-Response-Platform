  This is a GenAI-Powered AIOps Platform.
  - The backend uses Python (FastAPI, Boto3) and AWS Lambda.
  - Infrastructure is managed via Terraform.
  - The frontend is React + Vite + Tailwind CSS.
  
  Please focus reviews on:
  1. Security (IAM roles, API keys, open ports).
  2. Error handling in Lambda functions.
  3. React performance and hook dependency arrays.
  4. Terraform resource tagging and best practices.
